# CovidHouseholdTransmissionDemo
A super quick demo I wrote back in February. Assuming all people in a household are in equal contact with one another and the transmission rate of a virus is known, what are the odds that person A having it causes person B to have it for N number of people? for a 2 person household, it's pretty simple, but beyond that, it becomes complicated because of the number of paths the virus can travel to reach Person B from Person A (and each path having it's own probability) becomes annoying to solve. This is just a quick unpolished demo of how to solve the problem in python. It computes the number of possible paths from person A to person B and the likelihood of each path occurring and then combines them
